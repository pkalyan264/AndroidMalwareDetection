# AndroidMalwareDetection
This project deals with choosing the best approach (Algorithm) to detect android malware using static analysis.

Abstract:
The Android smartphone, with its wide range of applications and excellent performance, has attracted
many users. However, this domination of the Android platform also has motivated the development
of malware. The traditional method which detects the malware based on the signature is unable to
detect unknown applications. This article uses a set of well known machine learning models and
compares the performances on the new set of applications(malicious and benign) . To achieve this we
extract features based on the static analysis and the dynamic analysis, then a new feature selection
approach based on principle component analysis (PCA) is presented in the article to decrease the
dimensions of the features. Experimental results show that our system provides an effective method
in Android malware detection using the Decision Tree Classifier model. Key words: Static Analysis;
Dynamic Analysis; PCA; Feature Selection; Decision tree Classifier

Problem Statement:
Smartphones have become the most used device in one’s day to day life. They facilitate users with a
variety of applications that are enriched with powerful features. It is almost impossible for anyone
these days to spend a day without their smartphones. Out of all smartphones, Android smartphones
are the ones that are widely used. This increasing popularity of Android smartphones has also attracted
malicious attackers. This malicious activity can be done by either a single application or a group of
applications working together. The objective of this project is to create a model that can detect such
malicious applications.

Introduction:
Recent years, with the rapid development of smartphones, Android is becoming more and more popular. 
According to the IDC report shown in the 2016 year, Android market share will reach 85.3% until the end
of 2016. Android has been more and more indispensable with its open source character and advantages of 
free in our daily life. However, the number of malicious software is also growing rapidly. Therefore, 
how to detect the Android malware with a high accurate rate is a hot issue. Traditional detection 
approach based on signature is widely used both in Android devices and PC by extracting the signature 
from APK and comparing it with the malicious signature in the virus database.However, this approach is
limited to detect unknown malwares which do exist in the virus database.

In order to address this problem,the previous researchers found that there are two techniques for the 
unknown Android malware analysis:Static analysis and Dynamic analysis. Static analysis, occurs before 
the Android application is installed, is a technique based on checking the contents of the APK by means 
of reverse engineering. Different from the static analysis, dynamic analysis monitors the running state
of the Android application in the virtual environment. With the development of machine learning 
technology, machine learning approaches are also mentioned to classify obtained observations as either 
benign or malicious by collecting different signal features and events from the applications and the 
system. However the raw features may exist irrelevant or redundant features that may lead to a wrong 
result, so feature selection process is vital. Feature extraction and feature selection are the crucial 
steps which determine the accuracy rate of the classifier.After that it will be easier to achieve the 
detection result with the classifier.

Motivated by above observations, we propose a classification system for Android platform based on the 
machine learning classifiers. Our system pays attention to the step of feature extraction and feature 
selection, we use static analysis to obtain the Android application’s features, and then a feature 
selection algorithm is employed to find the most discriminating feature subset. Experimental results show 
that our method can accurately identify Android malware.
